# Mental Health Detection using NLP

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing text from online platforms such as **Reddit, Twitter, and chatbot interactions** to detect early signs of **anxiety and depression** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The goal is to explore how different feature representations and models perform on real-world mental health–related text, while also emphasizing **model interpretability** through explainable AI techniques.

## 🧠 What We Built & Learned
- Analyzed text data from online platforms to identify linguistic patterns associated with anxiety and depression  
- Preprocessed and cleaned large volumes of real-world mental health–related text  
- Applied multiple NLP feature representations and models:
  - **TF-IDF** features with **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**
  - **Sequence embeddings** with **LSTM**
  - **Contextual embeddings** using **DistilBERT**
- Incorporated **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** to interpret predictions and improve model transparency  

This project provided hands-on experience in **NLP for mental health**, **explainable AI**, and **collaborative ML research workflows**.
